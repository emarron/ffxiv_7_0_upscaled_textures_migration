Contains some documentation, scripts, and chaiNNer chains.

Of particular interest are:

- diagrams documentation
- the ffxiv_id_upscaler_gui.py which upscales ID textures.
- sha checks for updating future content.
- many chaiNNer chains related to upscaling ffxiv content.

These are all things I used to help
1. find which textures to ignore
2. migrate textures which could be migrated
3. create new textures
4. dispose or update textures as square enix continues through dawntrial.

Further tools can be found under:

https://github.com/emarron/kartoffels-terrible-image-tools - this is ancient but may be of use to some

https://github.com/NotNite/Alpha - very fast exporter of ffxiv files

https://rl2.perchbird.dev/Downloads - reslogger 2 paths, use the "CurrentPathList.zip" which contains as CurrentPathList.txt" that you can feed to Alpha.

https://github.com/xivapi/SaintCoinach/tree/master - browser for getting human-readable names associated with objects if they have them. This is useful for things such as mounts.

https://github.com/goaaats/ffxiv-explorer-fork - This still works just give it an updated csv from reslogger. For more precise browsing.
