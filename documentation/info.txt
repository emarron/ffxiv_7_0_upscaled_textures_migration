research on bg types:
bg consists of: _d diffuse, _n normal, and _s specular.
further can be categorized as has alpha or does not. usually only diffuse has alpha.
Almost all specular are changed. I do not modify specular so that is ignored.
Almost all diffuse of not alpha type are substantially identical. However do to recompressing, they present a small difference which must be detected by similarity checks exceeding 98%.
Almost all normal are substantially identical simliar to diffuse. However, certain normals have had data added to their B channel. because of this we perform the similarity check.

For BC1 of same size in 6_3 and 7_0:
1. convert to png (Because of all BC1_UNORM w/ 1.bit being converted to BC7 we can assume no transparency for these images)
2. similarity check
3. if similarity check > 98% we have identical textures.
4. if not we have new textures.

For not the same size in 6_3 and 7_0:
1. we assume some substantial difference.
2. if resolution differs we assume new.
3. if resolution doesn't differ but compression does we assume inspection.
4. We should inspect conversions from BC1_UNORM /w 1.bit alpha to BC7
5. We should inspect conversions from BC3_UNORM to BC7.
6. in 4 and 5 problems could be present, however, the corpus should be small enough for a manual review of each.


If we found identical textures what do we do?
1. copy the textures from the upscaled textures pack as they can just be reimplemented directly.
